In this program, I used 2D arrays to store the attendance and marks of 5 students in 5 subjects, along with another array to store their names. Using loops, I first took input for the names, attendance, and marks. Then I created a menu using a while loop and switch-case so the user can choose what to display. For attendance, I counted how many times each student was present or absent and then found who had the highest and lowest attendance. For marks, I calculated total marks and average marks for each student and identified the topper and the lowest performer. Finally, based on the average marks, I assigned grades using simple if-else conditions.
