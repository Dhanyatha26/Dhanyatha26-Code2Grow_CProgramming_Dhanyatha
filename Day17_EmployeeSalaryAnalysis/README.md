# Employee Salary Analysis System (Day 17)
This is a simple C program made for the Code2Grow Challenge (Day 17).  
It helps to analyze employee salaries using arrays and basic C concepts.

## What the program does
1. Takes the student name, registration number, and section.
2. Lets the user enter salaries of up to 10 employees.
3. Shows a menu with these options:
   - Display all salaries  
   - Show total and average salary  
   - Show highest and lowest salary  
   - Count employees above and below average  
   - Sort salaries in ascending order (bubble sort)
4. The program repeats the menu until the user chooses to exit.

## How it works
- Loops are used to calculate totals, averages, and comparisons.  
- If-else statements are used for conditions.
